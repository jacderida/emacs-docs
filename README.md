# Emacs Configuration

As of November 2017, I had been using Vim as my main editor for around 3 years. I put a lot of effort into customisation, and generally loved the experience using it. I came from a Microsoft background, so I had a history of using Visual Studio as my main development environment. After configuring Vim with plugins like [YouCompleteMe][https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe], I found I had a very reasonable approximation of a full IDE experience, and loved how light weight Vim was in comparison to Studio. Then, after learning of the existence of [Evil Mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) and watching [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWD1Fpdd4Pc) by Aaron Bieber, I was inspired to switch to Emacs. Initially, I considered using Spacemacs, but came to the conclusion it was adding too much, and learning Emacs from scratch was better option for me.

This document describes my journey to configure Emacs in such a way that it replicated all the functionality I enjoyed from Vim.
